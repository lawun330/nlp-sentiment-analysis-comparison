    "## SVM: Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "For sentiment analysis, TF-IDF is well-suited for SVM because it reduces the impact of very frequent but uninformative words (such as \"the\", \"is\") and highlights sentiment-bearing terms (like \"bad\", \"excellent\"). TF-IDF provides better feature scaling and normalization, which aligns well with SVM's optimization process and helps the model find better decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TfidfVectorizer` is a text feature extraction method from the `scikit-learn` library. It is used to **transform a collection of review texts into a TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weighted model**, represented as a sparse matrix. The process is as follows:\n",
    "- `fit()`: Learns the vocabulary from the training data and calculates the inverse document frequency (IDF) weights (does not create a matrix yet).\n",
    "- `transform()`: Encodes text into a TF-IDF weighted model, represented as a sparse matrix.\n",
    "- `fit_transform()`: Combines both steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of the matrix corresponds to a review, and each column corresponds to a unique word (or n-gram) in the entire collection of reviews. The **value at each position represents the TF-IDF score** of that word in the review, which is calculated as the product of:\n",
    "- **Term Frequency (TF)**: How often the word appears in the review (normalized by review length).\n",
    "- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: How rare or common the word is across all reviews (logarithmically scaled).\n",
    "\n",
    "This scoring mechanism means that words that appear frequently in a specific review but rarely across all reviews receive higher TF-IDF scores, making them more distinctive and informative for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Given a review \"this is is not good\":\n",
    "- \"this is is not good\" &#8594; {this: 0.23, is: 0.45, not: 0.31, good: 0.52} &#8594; [0.23, 0.45, 0.31, 0.52]\n",
    "  - Higher scores indicate more distinctive words (e.g., \"good\" = 0.52, \"not\" = 0.31)\n",
    "  - Lower scores indicate less distinctive or more common words (e.g., \"this\" = 0.23, \"is\" = 0.45, but \"is\" appears twice so it gets a higher TF component)\n",
    "- row: \"this is is not good\"\n",
    "- column: [0.23, 0.45, 0.31, 0.52] (where position 0=this, position 1=is, position 2=not, position 3=good)\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "It **does not perform padding** as it only creates <u>fixed-size</u> feature vectors <u>(not sequences)</u> for each review. The length of these vectors is determined by the total number of unique words (or n-grams) across all reviews (i.e., the vocabulary). The number of features can be controlled by setting the `max_features` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If `max_features = 3`, the method will only consider the 3 most important words in the corpus for TF-IDF calculation.\n",
    "- \"this is not good\" &#8594; {good: 0.52, is: 0.45, not: 0.31} &#8594; {is: 0.45, not: 0.31, good: 0.52} &#8594; [0.45, 0.31, 0.52]\n",
    "\n",
    "Any word not in the top `max_features` vocabulary is ignored everywhere, no matter where it appears in a review.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it only **calculates TF-IDF scores for words** in each review and **ignores their order**, different word sequences that contain the same words will produce identical feature vectors (assuming the same TF-IDF scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- \"this is not good\" &#8594; {this: 0.23, is: 0.45, not: 0.31, good: 0.52} &#8594; [0.23, 0.45, 0.31, 0.52]\n",

    "\n",
    "However, it **can capture local word order** by using n-grams (e.g., bigrams), allowing it to distinguish phrases such as \"not good\" from \"good not\".\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes these parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_features`: Limits the vocabulary to the top N words (or n-grams) by document frequency, reducing dimensionality and focusing on the most informative terms. `max_features=None` uses all words.\n",
    "- `ngram_range`: Specifies the n-gram sizes to extract _(min_n, max_n)_.\n",
    "> Example: `ngram_range = (1, 2)` captures unigrams and bigrams:\n",
    "> - \"this is not good\" &#8594; [\"this\", \"is\", \"not\", \"good\", \"this is\", \"is not\", \"not good\"]\n",
    "- `min_df`: Removes very rare words (by minimum document count or proportion), which are often noise or typos and add little useful information.\n",
    "- `max_df`: Removes very common words (by maximum document count or proportion), which usually carry little discriminative power for classification."
