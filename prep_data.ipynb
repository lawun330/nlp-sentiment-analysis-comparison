    "## Main Preprocessing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of preprocessing. First, **invalid entries** within the dataframe must be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second type of preprocessing focuses on **word normalization**, as sentiment analysis emphasizes the meaning conveyed by words rather than irrelevant details. There are many elements in a sentence, such as punctuation, stop words, and certain numbers, that do not influence sentiment. These can be removed or adjusted to help the model focus on the important aspects of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, each sentence in the dataset is preprocessed using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert to lowercase**\n",
    "    - `HE is not EnJoYiNG./n` &#8594; `he is not enjoying./n`\n",
    "2. **Remove newline characters**\n",
    "    - `he is not enjoying./n` &#8594; `he is not enjoying.`\n",
    "3. **Remove punctuation**\n",
    "    - `he is not enjoying.` &#8594; `he is not enjoying`\n",
    "4. **Remove stop words** except for \"not\" and other negation words that can indicate negative sentiment\n",
    "    - `he is not enjoying` &#8594; `not enjoying`\n",
    "5. **Apply stemming** using the *Porter Stemmer*\n",
    "    - `not enjoying` &#8594; `not enjoy`\n",
    "6. **Remove digits** unless they are related to sentiment\n",
    "    - `It costs $300` &#8594; `It costs`\n",
    "    - `10 out of 10 service` &#8594; `10 out of 10 service`\n",
    "7. **Apply lemmatization** which can be computationally expensive for large datasets (optional)\n",
    "    - `enjoyable` &#8594; `enjoy`\n",
    "    - `we had a good time` &#8594; `we have a good time`\n",
    "\n",
    "The third type of preprocessing deals with **limiting the number of words** in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sentence can have an arbitrary number of words. In simple models like NBC, the length of individual sentences is less important. However, deep learning models (like RNNs, CNNs, or transformers) expect fixed-length inputs. Therefore, sentences must be padded (with additional words) or truncated (by removing words) to ensure they all have the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cutoff value is arbitrary. In this project, the 90th percentile of sentence lengths, based on the distribution of sentence lengths in the dataset, can be used as a cutoff to set a maximum sentence length (the maximum number of words a sentence can have). This ensures that too much information is not lost while the model can still handle variable-length input effectively."
